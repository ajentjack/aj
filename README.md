Click on matching bubbles, beat the timer, and score points in this browser-based Bubble Game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gauravgorade/bubble-game.git


## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll see bubbles displayed on the screen.

2. Look at the "Hit" number at the top of the screen. Click on the bubbles that match the hit number to score points.

3. The game also includes a timer that starts from 60 seconds. You need to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.

4. If you click a bubble with a number that matches the hit number, you earn 10 points. If the numbers don't match, no points are added.

5. Your score is displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.

6. The game ends when the timer reaches 0. A message will be displayed showing your final score.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game's appearance, you can do so by modifying the `style.css` file. You can adjust the colors, fonts, and other visual elements to your liking.
